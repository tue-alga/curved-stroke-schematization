# Curved Stroke Schematization

This project provides code developed in context of research into the schematization of (metro) networks and subdivisions using circular arcs. 
That is, it aims to reduce its number of vertices by replacing edges with arcs, while keeping the result similar to their original geometry.

The algorithm is described and tested in https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11593-1_1
This version of the code has been slightly modified, now building on the GeometryCore (https://github.com/tue-alga/GeometryCore), version v1.1.0. Slight deviations in results may occur.
